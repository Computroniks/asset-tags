# Asset Tags

Asset Tags are used everywhere. They are vital to keeping track of
equipment within an organization. Often, we use tags that have specific
meanings encoded into them, for example one prefix for networking
equipment, another for user devices. It can be hard to keep track of
where we are up to. Asset Tags is a simple go application designed to
run in a container to help you to make sure that you never again suffer
the pain of assets with duplicate tags.
